- SYN_MT_REPORT : instructs the receiver to accept the data for the current contact and prepare to receive another

- SYN_REPORT :  raw data for all present contacts are sent between every synchronization

- ABS_MT_SLOT : Instructs the receiver to prepare for updates of the given slot

- ABS_MT_TRACKING_ID : Creation, replacement and destruction of contacts is achieved by modifying the associated slot.

- ABS_MT_SLOT :  total number of type B slots reported

- ev.type : The type field essentially tells you what kind of event you're dealing with: is it a key press, a touch event, a mouse movement, etc.
	+ EV_KEY for key/button press events
	+ EV_ABS for absolute positioning
	+ EV_REL for relative positioning
	+ EV_SYN for synchronization events

- ev.code : provides more specific information within the given event type. It specifies exactly which key, button, or axis the event is about.
	+ For EV_KEY events (keyboard or button press), ev.code 	  would be a key code like KEY_A, KEY_ENTER, etc.
	+ For EV_ABS events ABS_MT_POSITION_X, ABS_MT_POSITION_Y for 	  multitouch coordinates, and so forth.
